        that we are an authentic loan providing organization with imperative
        assent from the RBI to disburse loans to eligible clients. It has come

        impersonating us through illicit means and demanding elicit fee charges
        with the bogus guarantee of giving them loans. Therefore, we strongly
        reprimand this fake and deceitful impersonation and hereby alert the

        Disclosure
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-gray-700 text-justify mt-2">
        We have noticed that some malicious individuals have started creating
        fake email ids and fake website/domain names, causing confusion among
        our customers with names similar to Paisaintime. We also noticed that
        many potential customers were tricked by various scammers in order to
        seduce them with false and unfounded promises.
      </p>
      <p className="text-2xl font-medium text-fontColorPrimary mt-4">
        That&apos;s why we warn the general public to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 text-justify mt-2">
            1. Raise awareness about any kind of fake email id, website, ads and
            domain impersonating Paisaintime and claiming that they are offering
            salary advances at a low interest rate, collect customer data,
            request money upfront for loan processing, etc.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 text-justify mt-2">
            2. Our credit partner has a complex process to review every
            potential credit request/application and comply with the legal
            guidelines set out in their due process. Paisaintime or any of our
            employees will never require any kind of prepayment from their
            clients before disbursing the loan.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 text-justify mt-2">
            3. The email id would necessarily contain @paisaintime.com and would
            not contain other domain names like Hotmail/Yahoo/Gmail etc or
            others.
          </p>

            Therefore, before deciding to deal with such scammers and to
            respond/admit to any kind of fake ads, websites, emails and calls to
            protect yourself from any kind of criminal activity.
          </p>
